Image Captioning and Translation Pipeline
Overview
This project leverages advanced machine learning models to generate captions for images and translate those captions into various languages. It utilizes the Vision Transformer (ViT) model for image captioning and the Google Translate API for language translation. Additionally, it converts the translated text into audio using Google's Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library.

Functionalities
1. Load Pre-trained Models
The code loads a pre-trained Vision Encoder-Decoder model (nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning), which is used for generating captions from images. It also initializes a feature extractor and a tokenizer for processing images and text.

2. Image Preprocessing
The images are preprocessed to ensure they are compatible with the input requirements of the Vision Transformer model.

3. Generate Image Captions
For each image processed, the model generates a caption that describes the content of the image. The caption is created using beam search to ensure better quality.

4. Translation of Captions
The generated captions can be translated into multiple languages using the Google Translate API. Supported languages include:

Telugu
Tamil
Hindi
French
Spanish
5. Text-to-Speech
The translated captions are converted into audio format using gTTS. The audio is played directly within the application, allowing users to hear the translated text.

6. Extract Images from ZIP File
The code can extract images from a ZIP file, allowing for batch processing of images in a single run. Users simply need to provide the path to the ZIP file containing the images.

Usage
Prepare a ZIP file containing the images you want to process (formats supported: jpg, jpeg, png).
Set the path to the ZIP file in the code:
python
Copy code
zip_path = '/content/img.zip'  # Change this to your ZIP file path
Run the script. The program will:
Extract images from the provided ZIP file.
Prompt you to select a destination language for translation.
Process each image, generating captions and translating them.
Play audio of the translated captions.
